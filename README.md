# FindWord
A simple CLI for finding the translation or meaning of a word.

## Installation
Soon.

## Usage

1. If you want to know the meaning of one or several words, you can use the following command:

    ```bash
    findword --words "hope car"
    ```

    That command will print several possible definitions for "hope" and "car" separately. Make sure you have separated it with a whitespace.
